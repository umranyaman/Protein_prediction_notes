# Transcript Sequences to Protein Predictions 

## This code translates transcript variants to functional protein predictions using various biological databases.


### The code is divided into three steps, which are included in separate notebooks:

1. Biological sequence and data manipulation with Biopython: This notebook loads transcript sequences in FASTA format and performs manipulation and analysis using Biopython.

2. Create an interactive Query Protein: This notebook allows the user to interactively query the UniProt database using a protein name or identifier.

3. Query Biological Databases using Biopython & web-scraping: This notebook shows how to programmatically query various biological databases using Biopython and web-scraping techniques.

Note that this is an ongoing work and updates to the code and notebooks may occur.

## Usage

To use this code, download the code and open the desired notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Follow the instructions in each notebook to load transcript or protein sequences, query databases, and visualize results.

Note: These steps are for demonstration purposes only, and the specific details may vary depending on the input data and chosen databases.
