Transcript to Protein (t2p)

This code translates transcript variants to functional protein predictions using various biological databases.

The code is divided into three steps, which are included in separate notebooks:

Biological sequence and data manipulation with Biopython: This notebook loads transcript sequences in FASTA format and performs manipulation and analysis using Biopython.

Create an interactive Query Protein: This notebook allows the user to interactively query the UniProt database using a protein name or identifier.

Query Biological Databases using Biopython & web-scraping: This notebook shows how to programmatically query various biological databases using Biopython and web-scraping techniques.
